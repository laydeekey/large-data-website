# Very Berry Berries

Berries have been around since the world began. Some or edible and some, inedible. They come in many colours, shapes, sizes, and flavours.

Some have seeds, and some don't; there are some fruits many wouldn't consider berries, but in fact they are!

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

It is also a way for us to get to know the many different berries of the world and the positive effects they can have on our bodies.

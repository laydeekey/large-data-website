		<p>The botanical definition of a <em>berry</em> is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary. Grapes are an example. The <em>berry</em> is the most common type of fleshy fruit in which the entire ovary wall ripens into an edible pericarp. They may have one or more carpels with a thin covering and fleshy interiors. The seeds are usually embedded in the flesh of the ovary (there are some non-fleshy exceptions, such as peppers). A plant that bears <em>berries</em> is said to be bacciferous or baccate (a fruit that resembles a <em>berry</em>, whether it actually is a <em>berry</em> or not, can also be called "<strong>baccate</strong>").</p>
		
		<p>In everyday English, "<em>berry</em>" is a term for any small edible fruit. These "<em>berries</em>" are usually juicy, round or semi-oblong, brightly coloured, sweet or sour, and do not have a stone or pit, although many seeds may be present.</p>
		
		<p>Many <em>berries</em>, such as the tomato, are edible, but others in the same family, such as the fruits of the deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) and the fruits of the potato (Solanum tuberosum) are poisonous to humans. Some <em>berries</em>, such as Capsicum, have space rather than pulp around their seeds.</p>
		
	<h3>Modified berries</h3>
	
		<p>The fruit of citrus, such as the orange, kumquat and lemon, is a berry with a thick rind and a very juicy interior that is given the special name hesperidium.
	Berries which develop from an inferior ovary are sometimes termed epigynous berries or false berries, as opposed to true berries which develop from a superior ovary.</p>

		<p>In epigynous berries, the berry includes tissue derived from parts of the flower besides the ovary. The floral tube, formed from the basal part of the sepals, petals and stamens can become fleshy at maturity and is united with the ovary to form the fruit. Common fruits that are sometimes classified as epigynous berries include bananas, coffee, members of the genus Vaccinium (e.g., cranberries and blueberries), and members of the family Cucurbitaceae (e.g., cucumbers, melons and squash).</p>
	
		<p>Another specialized term is also used for Cucurbitaceae fruits, which are modified to have a hard outer rind, and are given the special name pepo. While pepos are most common in the Cucurbitaceae, the fruits of Passiflora and Carica are sometimes also considered pepos.</p>

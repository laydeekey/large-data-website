  <span itemprop="name">Gluten-Free Strawberry Shortcake Pancakes</span>

  <span itemprop="description">These pancakes are just like the thick, fluffy 
  kind you’d be served in a restaurant. I’ve never been to a restaurant that takes
  it to this level though—with four layers of thick, gluten-free and vegan pancakes, 
  coconut whipped cream and sliced strawberries. It’s like eating dessert for 
  breakfast, but in a healthy way! I’d serve these with maple syrup for an extra
  sweet treat.</span>

  Ingredients:
  - <span itemprop="ingredients">1 1/2 cups buckwheat flour</span>
  - <span itemprop="ingredients">1 1/2 tsp baking powder</span>
  - <span itemprop="ingredients">1/2 tsp sea salt></span>
  - <span itemprop="ingredients">1/4 tsp ground cinnamon</span>
  - <span itemprop="ingredients">1/8 tsp grated nutmeg</span>
  - <span itemprop="ingredients">2 cups non-dairy milk</span>
  - <span itemprop="ingredients">1 cup pitted Medjool dates</span>
  - <span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp fresh lemon juice</span>
  - <span itemprop="ingredients">1 can (13.5oz) full-fat coconut milk, refrigerated overnight</span>
  - <span itemprop="ingredients">2-3 tsp agave nectar or other sweetener</span>
  - <span itemprop="ingredients">Seeds of one vanilla bean</span>
  - <span itemprop="ingredients">2 cups fresh strawberries, sliced</span>
  ...

  Instructions:
  <span itemprop="recipeInstructions">
  Scoop the cream from the top of the can, reserving the coconut water at the bottom of the can for other uses, like smoothies.
Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whip the coconut cream until smooth and fluffy, about one minute. Add sweetener and vanilla seeds and whip until incorporated. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Pancakes:
To make the pancakes, whisk together the buckwheat flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg in a large bowl.
In a high-speed blender, blend the almond milk, dates and lemon juice until well combined and smooth. Pour this mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir until a thick batter is formed.

Preheat an oiled skillet over medium heat. Scoop 1/3 cup of batter onto the skillet and smooth out with the back of a spoon. Cook until the bottom is lightly browned, then carefully flip over to cook the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
To assemble, place a pancake on a clean plate, place a layer of sliced strawberries and then spread or pipe the coconut whipped cream on top. Repeat with as many layers as you want (one or two per person is probably enough). Serve immediately.
